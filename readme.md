# DIGITAL-LIBRARY API

## Installation:

    * step 1: install miniconda to use conda package manager:

        * download miniconda:
            wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
        * install miniconda: bash Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
        (by default it will install Python 2.7.13, digital library api currently supported on python 2.7.13)

    * step 2: setup virtualenv:

        * install virtualenv using conda:
                if we install miniconda it will install at "/home/<user_name>/miniconda2"
                activate root environment to access conda package
                 cd /home/<user_name>/miniconda2
                 source bin/activate
                 Note: now conda package available,
                       we can use to install another environment for digital library api rather than default root env.

        * creating dl_env and installing depences:

                conda create --name dl_env -f environment.yml

        * activate virtualenv:

                source dl_name/bin/activate

        * mongodb installation:
            conda install -c anaconda mongodb=3.3.9

## Running:

    * In the configuration folder, we have to edit json files based on environment
    * Edit run.sh file in scripts folder:

            * edit path of virtualenv and project folder

            * give proper env_name=dev|tst|prd|stg

    * Running project:

             run ./run.sh file to start project.

## Gunicorn: Gunicorn 'Green Unicorn' is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.

   * Setup gunicorn with python application:

        gunicorn --bind host_name:port --timeout <count value> <APP_MODULE>:<Python_WSGI_APP> --env env_name=<environment name>

        EX: gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0:8001 --timeout 1000 runserver:app --env env_name=tst
        Note: we can use --workers or --threads option to serve incoming request by multiple threads or process.

   * writing UpStart Script:

        * create file in /etc/init/name.conf
        * insert folowing lines into name.conf file:

            description "Gunicorn application server running fab project"

            start on runlevel [2345]
            stop on runlevel [!2345]

            respawn
            setuid user
            setgid www-data
            exec gunicorn --bind 0:8001 --workers 3 --timeout 1000 runserver:app --env env_name=tst

   * Starting and Stoping project:

        sudo service fab start
                or
        sudo service fab stop
                or
        sudo service fab restart

Note: if web server not serving static data we dnt need to configure Proxy server.
       otherwise recomanded Proxy is NGINx. If you choose another proxy server you need to make sure that it buffers slow clients
      when you use default Gunicorn workers. Without this buffering Gunicorn will be easily susceptible to
      denial-of-service attacks. You can use Hey to check if your proxy is behaving properly.
